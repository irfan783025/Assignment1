Assignment number one

1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*        Mathematical operator (expressions )
;hello;  String  (expressions )
-87.8    integer
-        Mathematical operator (expressions )
/        Mathematical operator (expressions )
+	 Mathematical operator (expressions )

6	its a value it can be change in to float


2.What is the difference between string and variable?
Strings 
string is a data type 
its immutable data type 
string always close in to quotation marks single double and triple
Variables:-
variables can store multiple values
its cant be start with reserve keywords
its cant be start with specail character 
its cant be start with white space

3. Describe three different data types.
data type diveded into two parts 
a)Basic data types  (integer , flaot , complex)
b)container data types (string , tuple , set , liat , dict)

tuple:-
tuples are ordered data type of collection 
its immutable means that we cant change any thing in the tuples 
its close in to the round brackets ()
tuples(12,34,56,78,89,"irfan khan",(12+23j)

list:-
list is a container data type 
its mutable data types
its close by quare breackets []
list=["irfan", 12,3,4,34,56,7899,[12,45,7,],34,56,(25,67,89,)]

set:-
set is the collection of unique value of data 
ita mutable 
close into the {}
set={"irfan khan" , 23,45,67,89,76,44,243}


4.)What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

An expression in Python is a combination of operators and operands. 

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

An expression evaluates to a single value. and the statement evaluets more then one values .




6.) 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

ans. its would be 23 because both are integer

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam'+spamspam

'spam'*3

ans.= spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

100 is a ineteger data type we cant take it as a variable 
eggs we can make a variable


9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

int(), flaot() , and str(),

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'i have eacten' , +99+'burritos'
ans its will give you error because two are strings and 99 is interger so we cant add these values
